/*
  Given an airplane's acceleration a and take-off speed v, you can compute
  the minimum runway length needed for an airplane to take off using the
  following formula:
                            length = (v^2 / 2a)
  Write a program that prompts the user to enter v in meters/second (m/s) and
  the acceleration a in meters/second squared (m/s^2), and displays the
  minimum runway length.
