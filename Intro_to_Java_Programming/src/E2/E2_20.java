  If you know the balance and the annual percentage interest rate, you can
  compute the interest on the next monthly payment using the following formula:
  interest = balance x (annualInterestRate / 1200)
  Write a program that reads the balance and the annual percentage interest
  rate and displays the interest for the next month.
