/*
(Science: wind-chill temperature) Programming Exercise 2.17 gives a formula
to compute the wind-chill temperature.The formula is valid for temperatures in
the range between -58F and 41F and wind speed greater than or equal to 2.
Write a program that prompts the user to enter a temperature and a wind speed.
The program displays the wind-chill temperature if the input is valid; otherwise,
it displays a message indicating whether the temperature and/or wind speed is
invalid.
