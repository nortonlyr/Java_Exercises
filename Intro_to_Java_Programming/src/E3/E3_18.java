/*
(Cost of shipping) A shipping company uses the following function to calculate
the cost (in dollars) of shipping based on the weight of the package (in
pounds).
							
							 3.5, if 0 < w < = 1
			     c(w) =  5.5, if 1 < w < = 3
							 8.5, if 3 < w < = 10
							 10.5, if 10 < w < = 20
Write a program that prompts the user to enter the weight of the package and
display the shipping cost. If the weight is greater than 50, display a message ¡°the
